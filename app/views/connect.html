<p>To connect the core for the first time, you will need the Spark App.</p>
<p>Once you've downloaded the Spark Core app from the App Store or Google Play, you'll be asked to connect your Core using a process called Smart Config. <em>NOTE: Your phone must be connected to the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect the Core to.  Wi-Fi Hotspots generated from the phone you are running this app on typically will yield an error claiming there is no Wi-Fi available.</em>  When connected to Wi-Fi, the app will automatically fill the SSID field with the name of the network that your phone is connected to.  Enter your Wi-Fi password and hit connect.</p>
